# Blackbody Intensity

For a spherical blackbody radiating the intensity of the radiation observes decreases with the square of the distance. This repository is a MATLAB function to do this with another implementation to look at the trend of intensity as distance increases from the body. You can specify the effective temperature, radius of the observed body and the distance from it.
